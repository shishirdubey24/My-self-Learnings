Ask yourself this:
"Is it enough to know the loading has stoppedâ€¦ or do I also need to know what happened after that?"

Consider what combination of flags (fetchDone, fetchFailed, currentFetching) can fully describe the state of your app at any moment.

Think of your component not just reacting to one piece of state, but instead making a decision based on the overall status of the fetch lifecycle.

Try sketching the 3 main phases: loading â†’ success â†’ error, and what flags are true/false in each phase.

If you draw that out, you'll realize exactly whatâ€™s missing from the logic â€” and how to make your component smarter about when to show what.

Take your time â€” Iâ€™ll be right here when you're ready to bounce ideas off! ðŸ§ âœ¨
